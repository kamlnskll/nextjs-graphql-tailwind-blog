# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v3.0)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

# Initial Upload Note (April 19, 2022)

- This project is based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYv55DhgTuA&t=9121s 

- Project is followed step-by-step

- Some mental notes after completing the tutorial:

This project helped me get a further grasp on Next.js and how it can be advantageous to learn for aspiring React developers. Furthermore, this was the most complicated project that I have tackled to far and it was nice to see how props get passed between components throughout the project.

This was also the first time that I used Tailwind CSS and it was interesting to see how it contrasted to other react component libraries like MUI, Chakra and Bootstrap. I think I will try using it more, as I often times had issues using those mentioned libraries, but that may just be due to my inexperience.

This project is not complete, as I did not leave many comments and did not do the featuredPosts part of the video.

# Plans

- At some point in the future, I would like to go through the code again and leave detailed comments throughout the project that can anyone can reference to see the thought process behind each block of code.
